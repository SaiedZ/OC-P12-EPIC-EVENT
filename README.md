## :page_with_curl: What's it ?

The EpicEvents CRM API allows users to manage data related to users, clients, contracts and events.

Our API allows users to make CRUD operations if permissions are respected. Permissions are based on the team of the user for some models and on support user or sale user for some other models. They are detailled in the API documentation.

Our API is organized around [REST](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer). It uses standard HTTP response codes, authentication, and verbs.

we have built this API respecting the recommendations of the OWASP top [10 recommandations](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/)

##  üìñ  API Documentation

[API documentation](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/19779552/Uz59Me61)

Once server is running, API specifications are accessible on those urls with different formats:

*   Swagger-ui view: [http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/schema/swagger-ui/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/schema/swagger-ui/)
*   ReDoc view: [http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/schema/redoc/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/schema/redoc/)
*   YAML schema: [http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/schema/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/schema/)

## :mag: Technologies

*   Django Rest Framework as backend
*   Postgresql as database
*   JWT (JSON Web Token) for the backend authentication

## üíø How to setup the API ?

**1. First, you will need to download [the source code](https://github.com/SaiedZ/OC-P12-EPIC-EVENT.git) from GitHub.**

**2. Unzip the folder**

**3. Go to the unzipped folder using your terminal**

**4. You can also clone the repo without dowloading the folder. In this case, don't follow the steps above and just: use these commands (git must be installed):**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/SaiedZ/OC-P12-EPIC-EVENT.git
cd OC-P12-EPIC-EVENT
```
**5. Create your virtual environment with the following command (here I call it .env, but you can call it another way)**
```bash
python -m venv .env
```
**6. Activate the virtual environment with the following command**
   * on Unix or Mac :
```shell
 source .env/bin/Activate
```
   * on Windows :
```bash
.env\Scripts\activate.bat
```

**7. Move to src folder**
```bash
cd src
```

**8. Install the packages required to run the tool from the `requirements.txt` file**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**9. Configure PostgreSQL database**

You first must install postgresSQL and configure a database.
See official [PostgreSQL doc](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/14/tutorial.html) and [official Django doc](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/ref/databases/#postgresql-notes) for more info.
You need to create a database for the app, and then configure it in epicevents/settings.py.

**10. Initiate Teams and EventStatus models**
```bash
pyhton manage.py init_teams
python manage.py init_event_status
```

**11. Initiate PostgreSQL database**

Open a terminal and navigate into the root of the project (i.e. the folder where is situated manage.py) , and run the following commands:

```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

## :sunglasses: Create a superuser (administrator)

Open a terminal and navigate into the root of the project (i.e. the folder where is situated manage.py) , and run the following command:
```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```
You will be prompted an email, username, first and last name, and a password. That's it, the superuser is created !

The admin page will be accessible at http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Launch the development server

First of all, you need to be located in the **src forlder**

To launch the development server locally, just use the `runserver` command from the `manage.py` file:

```
python manage.py runserver
``` 
Of course, you must first ensure that you have activated your virtual environment and that you are in the folder that contains the `manage.py` file.

Once the development server is launched, you can start using the API by following the documentation.

API will be accessible (with Postman for example) at http://127.0.0.1:8000 .

## :detective: Logging

Logs are registered in two files at the root of the project in a folder named ` logs `:

* debug.log, which shows all messages, but only activated if DEBUG is set to True in CRM/settings.py
* warning.log which shows messages from WARNING level and above. It is always active.
